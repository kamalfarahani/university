Ta. Sin. Mim. 1 These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. 2 We narrate unto thee somewhat of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for folk who believe. 3 Lo! Pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes. A tribe among them he oppressed, killing their sons and sparing their women. Lo! he was of those who work corruption. 4 And We desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth, and to make them examples and to make them the inheritors, 5 And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them. 6 And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: Suckle him and, when thou fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve. Lo! We shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him one of Our messengers. 7 And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a sorrow, Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning. 8 And the wife of Pharaoh said: He will be a consolation for me and for thee. Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us, or we may choose him for a son. And they perceived not. 9 And the heart of the mother of Moses became void, and she would have betrayed him if We had not fortified her heart, that she might be of the believers. 10 And she said unto his sister: Trace him. So she observed him from afar, and they perceived not. 11 And We had before forbidden foster-mothers for him, so she said: Shall I show you a household who will rear him for you and take care of him? 12 So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them know not. 13 And when he reached his full strength and was ripe, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward the good. 14 And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies; and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is of the devil's doing. Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleader. 15 He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul, so forgive me. Then He forgave him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 16 He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me, I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty. 17 And morning found him in the city, fearing, vigilant, when behold! he who had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said unto him: Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead. 18 And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both, he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday? Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land, thou wouldst not be of the reformers. 19 And a man came from the uttermost part of the city, running. He said: O Moses! Lo! the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee; therefor escape. Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice. 20 So he escaped from thence, fearing, vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing folk. 21 And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord will guide me in the right road. 22 And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of men, watering. And he found apart from them two women keeping back their flocks. He said: What aileth you? The two said: We cannot give our flocks to drink till the shepherds return from the water; and our father is a very old man. 23 So he watered their flock for them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me. 24 Then there came unto him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water the flock for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the whole story, he said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk. 25 One of the two women said: O my father! Hire him! For the best man that thou canst hire is the strong, the trustworthy. 26 He said: Lo! I fain would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for the term of eight pilgrimages. Then if thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord, for I would not make it hard for thee. Allah willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous. 27 He said: That is settled between thee and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say. 28 Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his housefolk, he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye here. Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence, or a brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves. 29 And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree: O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; 30 Throw down thy staff. And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon, he turned to flee headlong, and it was said unto him: O Moses! Draw nigh and fear not. Lo! thou art of those who are secure. 31 Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without hurt. And guard thy heart from fear. Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs. Lo! they are evil-living folk. 32 He said: My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me. 33 My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech. Therefor send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Lo! I fear that they will give the lie to me. 34 He said: We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother, and We will give unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for Our portents. Ye twain, and those who follow you, will be the winners. 35 But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens, they said: This is naught but invented magic. We never heard of this among our fathers of old. 36 And Moses said: My Lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance from His presence, and whose will be the sequel of the Home of bliss. Lo! wrong-doers will not be successful. 37 And Pharaoh said: O chiefs! I know not that ye have a god other than me, so kindle for me a fire, O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey the God of Moses; and lo! I deem him of the liars. 38 And he and his hosts were haughty in the land without right, and deemed that they would never be brought back to Us. 39 Therefor We seized him and his hosts, and abandoned them unto the sea. Behold the nature of the consequence for evil-doers! 40 And We made them patterns that invite unto the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. 41 And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the hateful. 42 And We verily gave the Scripture unto Moses after We had destroyed the generations of old: clear testimonies for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that haply they might reflect. 43 And thou Muhammad wast not on the western side of the Mount when We expounded unto Moses the commandment, and thou wast not among those present; 44 But We brought forth generations, and their lives dragged on for them. And thou wast not a dweller in Midian, reciting unto them Our revelations, but We kept sending messengers to men. 45 And thou was not beside the Mount when We did call; but the knowledge of it is a mercy from thy Lord that thou mayst warn a folk unto whom no warner came before thee, that haply they may give heed. 46 Otherwise, if disaster should afflict them because of that which their own hands have sent before them, they might say: Our Lord! Why sentest Thou no messenger unto us, that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the believers? 47 But when there came unto them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Why is he not given the like of what was given unto Moses? Did they not disbelieve in that which was given unto Moses of old? They say: Two magics that support each other; and they say: Lo! in both we are disbelievers. 48 Say unto them, O Muhammad: Then bring a scripture from the presence of Allah that giveth clearer guidance than these two that I may follow it, if ye are truthful. 49 And if they answer thee not, then know that what they follow is their lusts. And who goeth farther astray than he who followeth his lust without guidance from Allah. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 50 And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them, that haply they may give heed. 51 Those unto whom We gave the Scripture before it, they believe in it, 52 And when it is recited unto them, they say: We believe in it. Lo! it is the Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it we were of those who surrender unto Him. 53 These will be given their reward twice over, because they are steadfast and repel evil with good, and spend of that wherewith We have provided them, 54 And when they hear vanity they withdraw from it and say: Unto us our works and unto you your works. Peace be unto you! We desire not the ignorant. 55 Lo! thou O Muhammad guidest not whom thou lovest, but Allah guideth whom He will. And He is best aware of those who walk aright. 56 And they say: If we were to follow the Guidance with thee we should be torn out of our land. Have We not established for them a sure sanctuary, whereunto the produce of all things is brought in trade, a provision from Our presence? But most of them know not. 57 And how many a community have We destroyed that was thankless for its means of livelihood! And yonder are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited after them save a little. And We, even We, were the inheritors. 58 And never did thy Lord destroy the townships, till He had raised up in their mother-town a messenger reciting unto them Our revelations. And never did We destroy the townships unless the folk thereof were evil-doers. 59 And whatsoever ye have been given is a comfort of the life of the world and an ornament thereof; and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting. Have ye then no sense? 60 Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find true like him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned? 61 On the day when He will call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye imagined? 62 Those concerning whom the Word will have come true will say: Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray even as we ourselves were astray. We declare our innocence before Thee: us they never worshipped. 63 And it will be said: Cry unto your so-called partners of Allah. And they will cry unto them, and they will give no answer unto them, and they will see the Doom. Ah, if they had but been guided! 64 And on the Day when He will call unto them and say: What answer gave ye to the messengers? 65 On that day all tidings will be dimmed for them, nor will they ask one of another, 66 But as for him who shall repent and believe and do right, he haply may be one of the successful. 67 Thy Lord createth what He willeth and chooseth. They have never any choice. Glorified be Allah and exalted above all that they associate with Him! 68 And thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal, and what they publish. 69 And He is Allah; there is no God save Him. His is all praise in the former and the latter state, and His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. 70 Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made night everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a God beside Allah who could bring you light? Will ye not then hear? 71 Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made day everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a God beside Allah who could bring you night wherein ye rest? Will ye not then see? 72 Of His mercy hath He appointed for you night and day, that therein ye may rest, and that ye may seek His bounty, and that haply ye may be thankful. 73 And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye pretended? 74 And We shall take out from every nation a witness and We shall say: Bring your proof. Then they will know that Allah hath the Truth, and all that they invented will have failed them. 75 Now Korah was of Moses' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the exultant; 76 But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as Allah hath been kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! Allah loveth not corrupters, 77 He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following? The guilty are not questioned of their sins. 78 Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that unto us had been give like of what hath been given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune. 79 But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will obtain it. 80 So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had no host to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can save themselves. 81 And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it for whom He will. If Allah had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us also. Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper. 82 As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward off evil. 83 Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what they did. 84 Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law will surely bring thee home again. Say: My Lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest. 85 Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers. 86 And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down unto thee; but call mankind unto thy Lord, and be not of those who ascribe partners unto Him. 87 And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. 88


Alif. Lam. Mim. 1 This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who ward off evil. 2 Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We have bestowed upon them; 3 And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee Muhammad and that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter. 4 These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful. 5 As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not. 6 Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom. 7 And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, when they believe not. 8 They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not. 9 In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie. 10 And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We are peacemakers only. 11 Are not they indeed the mischief-makers ? But they perceive not. 12 And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: Shall we believe as the foolish believe? Beware! They indeed are the foolish? But they know not. 13 And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but mock. 14 Allah Himself doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy. 15 These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided. 16 Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, where they cannot see, 17 Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not. 18 Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps, for fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers. in His guidence 19 The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is able to do all things. 20 O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you, so that ye may ward off evil. 21 Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy; and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know better. 22 And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave Muhammad, then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness beside Allah if ye are truthful. 23 And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones. 24 And give glad tidings O Muhammad unto those who believe and do good works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for ever they abide. 25 Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat or anything above that. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What doth Allah wish to teach by such a similitude? He misleadeth many thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants; 26 Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that which Allah ordered to be joined, and who make mischief in the earth: Those are they who are the losers. 27 How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you! Then He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will return. 28 He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He to the heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things. 29 And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a viceroy in the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee? He said: Surely I know that which ye know not. 30 And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying: Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful. 31 They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise. 32 He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide. 33 And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever. 34 And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye freely of the fruits thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers. 35 But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the happy state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto the other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time. 36 Then Adam received from his Lord words of revelation, and He relented toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful. 37 We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh unto you from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 38 But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 39 O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and fulfil your part of the covenant, I shall fulfil My part of the covenant, and fear Me. 40 And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess already of the Scripture, and be not first to disbelieve therein, and part not with My revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty unto Me. 41 Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth. 42 Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who bow in worship. 43 Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget to practise it? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no sense? 44 Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the humble-minded, 45 Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are returning. 46 O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to all creatures. 47 And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped. 48 And remember when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk, who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women: that was a tremendous trial from your Lord. 49 And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned the folk of Pharaoh in your sight. 50 And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights of solitude, and then ye chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were wrong-doers. 51 Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks. 52 And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion of right and wrong, that ye might be led aright. 53 And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves by your choosing of the calf for worship so turn in penitence to your Creator, and kill the guilty yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. 54 And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you. 55 Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks. 56 And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you the manna and the quails, saying: Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you - They wrong us not, but they did wrong themselves. 57 And when We said: Go into this township and eat freely of that which is therein, and enter the gate prostrate, and say: "Repentance." We will forgive you your sins and will increase reward for the right-doers. 58 But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven for their evil-doing. 59 And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs so that each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth. 60 And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for their disobedience and transgression. 61 Lo! Those who believe in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad, and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabians - whoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 62 And remember, O Children of Israel when We made a covenant with you and caused the mount to tower above you, saying: Hold fast that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off evil. 63 Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers. 64 And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! 65 And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and an admonition to the God-fearing. 66 And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us? He answered: Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish! 67 They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what cow she is. Moses answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor immature; she is between the two conditions; so do that which ye are commanded. 68 They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is. Moses answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow cow. Bright is her colour, gladdening beholders. 69 They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what cow she is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright. 70 Moses answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not. 71 And remember when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding. 72 And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand. 73 Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened and became as rocks, or worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush, and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And indeed there are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 74 Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood it, knowingly? 75 And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe. But when they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of that which Allah hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning it? Have ye then no sense? 76 Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim? 77 Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from hearsay. They but guess. 78 Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say, "This is from Allah," that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn thereby. 79 And they say: The Fire of punishment will not touch us save for a certain number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah - truly Allah will not break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not? 80 Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. 81 And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of the Garden. They will abide therein. 82 And remember when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: Worship none save Allah only, and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being averse. 83 And when We made with you a covenant saying: Shed not the blood of your people nor turn a party of your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified Our covenant and ye were witnesses thereto. 84 Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression-and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 85 Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support. 86 And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs of Allah's sovereignty, and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a messenger from Allah with that which ye yourselves desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay? 87 And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe. 88 And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know to be the truth they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers. 89 Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His bondmen. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom. 90 And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say unto them, O Muhammad: Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime, if ye are indeed believers? 91 And Moses came unto you with clear proofs of Allah's Sovereignty, yet, while he was away, ye chose the calf for worship and ye were wrong-doers. 92 And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, saying: Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear Our Word, they said: We hear and we rebel. And worship of the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection of the covenant. Say unto them: Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers. 93 Say unto them: If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind as ye pretend, then long for death for ye must long for death if ye are truthful. 94 But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers. 95 And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and greedier than the idolaters. Each one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live a thousand years would be no means remove him from the doom. Allah is Seer of what they do. 96 Say O Muhammad, to mankind: Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who hath revealed this Scripture to thy heart by Allah's leave, confirming that which was revealed before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers; 97 Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael! Then, lo! Allah Himself is an enemy to the disbelievers. 98 Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will disbelieve in them. 99 Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside? The truth is, most of them believe not. 100 And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming that which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not, 101 And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they the two angels teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not in the guidance of Allah. And from these two angles people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no happy portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. 102 And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would be better, if they only knew. 103 O ye who believe, say not unto the Prophet: "Listen to us" but say "Look upon us," and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom. 104 Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 105 Such of our revelation as We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but we bring in place one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that Allah is Able to do all things? 106 Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any friend or helper? 107 Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime? He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road. 108 Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent toward them until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 109 Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of what ye do. 110 And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof of what ye state if ye are truthful. 111 Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 112 And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing true, and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing true; yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even thus speak those who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ. 113 And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for their ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear. Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom. 114 Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 115 And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay, but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto Him. 116 The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. 117 And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us, or some sign come unto us? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those who were before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for people who are sure. 118 Lo! We have sent thee O Muhammad with the truth, a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire. 119 And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah Himself is Guidance. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor helper. 120 Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the losers. 121 O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to all creatures. 122 And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession be of use to it; nor will they be helped. 123 And remember when his Lord tried Abraham with His commands, and he fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind. Abraham said: And of my offspring will there be leaders? He said: My covenant includeth not wrong-doers. 124 And when We made the House at Mecca a resort for mankind and sanctuary, saying: Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood to pray. And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, saying: Purify My house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves in worship. 125 And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and bestow upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day, He answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's end! 126 And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, Abraham prayed: Our Lord! Accept from us this duty. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower. 127 Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful. 128 Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, Wise. 129 And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself? Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the righteous. 130 When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds. 131 The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, saying: O my sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the true religion; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered unto Him. 132 Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons: What will ye worship after me? They said: We shall worship thy God, the God of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One God, and unto Him we have surrendered. 133 Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they earned, and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. 134 And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say unto them, O Muhammad: Nay, but we follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters. 135 Say O Muslims: We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered. 136 And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are they rightly guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism, and Allah will suffice thee for defence against them. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 137 We take our colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring. We are His worshippers. 138 Say unto the People of the Scripture: Dispute ye with us concerning Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord? Ours are our works and yours your works. We look to Him alone. 139 Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 140 Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. 141 The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the qiblah which they formerly observed? Say: Unto Allah belong the East and the West. He guideth whom He will unto a straight path. 142 Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard test save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful towards mankind. 143 We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven for guidance, O Muhammad. And now verily We shall make thee turn in prayer toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye O Muslims, wheresoever ye may be, turn your faces when ye pray toward it. Lo! Those who have received the Scripture know that this revelation is the Truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do. 144 And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor canst thou be a follower of their qiblah; nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then surely wert thou of the evil-doers. 145 Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise this revelation as they recognise their sons. But lo! a party of them knowingly conceal the truth. 146 It is the Truth from thy Lord O Muhammad, so be not thou of those who waver. 147 And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so vie with one another in good works. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you all together. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 148 And whencesoever thou comest forth for prayer, O Muhammad turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord. Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 149 Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship; and wheresoever ye may be O Muslims turn your faces toward it when ye pray so that men may have no argument against you, save such of them as do injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace upon you, and that ye may be guided. 150 Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you, who reciteth unto you Our revelations and causeth you to grow, and teacheth you the Scripture and wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye knew not. 151 Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give thanks to Me, and reject not Me. 152 O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness and prayer. Lo! Allah is with the steadfast. 153 And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah "dead." Nay, they are living, only ye perceive not. 154 And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives and crops; but give glad tidings to the steadfast, 155 Who say, when a misfortune striketh them: Lo! we are Allah's and lo! unto Him we are returning. 156 Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy. Such are the rightly guided. 157 Lo! the mountains As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House of Allah or visiteth it, to go around them as the pagan custom is. And he who doeth good of his own accord, for him lo! Allah is Responsive, Aware. 158 Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after We had made it clear in the Scripture: such are accursed of Allah and accursed of those who have the power to curse. 159 Except such of them -as repent and amend and make manifest the truth. These it is toward whom I relent. I am the Relenting, the Merciful. 160 Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers; on them is the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. 161 They ever dwell therein. The doom will not be lightened for them, neither will they be reprieved. 162 Your God is One God; there is no God save Him, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 163 Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of night and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men, and the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the earth after its death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and in the ordinance of the winds, and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth: are signs of Allah's Sovereignty for people who have sense. 164 Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves objects of worship which they set as rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like that which is the due of Allah only - Those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah - Oh, that those who do evil had but known, on the day when they behold the doom, that power belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment! 165 On the day when those who were followed disown those who followed them, and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them. 166 And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire. 167 O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 168 He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should tell concerning Allah that which ye know not. 169 And when it is said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance? 170 The likeness of those who disbelieve in relation to the messenger is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout and cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense. 171 O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and render thanks to Allah if it is indeed He Whom ye worship. 172 He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that which hath been immolated to the name of any other than Allah. But he who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 173 Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed and purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a painful doom. 174 Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and torment at the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire! 175 That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo! those who find a cause of disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism. 176 It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West; but righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due. And those who keep their treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the God-fearing. 177 O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his injured brother, prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this will have a painful doom. 178 And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding, that ye may ward off evil. 179 It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he leave wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness. This is a duty for all those who ward off evil. 180 And whoso changeth the will after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is only upon those who change it. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 181 But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause, and maketh peace between the parties, it shall be no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 182 O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off evil; 183 Fast a certain number of days; and for him who is sick among you, or on a journey, the same number of other days; and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need - but whoso doeth good of his own accord, it is better for him: and that ye fast is better for you if ye did but know - 184 The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the Criterion of right and wrong. And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, let him fast the same number of other days. Allah desireth for you ease; He desireth not hardship for you; and He desireth that ye should complete the period, and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that peradventure ye may be thankful. 185 And when My servants question thee concerning Me, then surely I am nigh. I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me. So let them hear My call and let them trust in Me, in order that they may be led aright. 186 It is made lawful for you to go unto your wives on the night of the fast. They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits imposed by Allah, so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they may ward off evil. 187 And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by it to gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a portion of the property of others wrongfully. 188 They ask thee, O Muhammad, of new moons, say: They are fixed seasons for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the backs thereof as do the idolaters at certain seasons, but the righteous man is he who wardeth off evil. So go to houses by the gates thereof, and observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful. 189 Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. 190 And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you there then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. 191 But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 192 And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrong-doers. 193 The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and forbidden things in retaliation. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he attacked you. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with those who ward off evil. 194 Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent. 195 Perform the pilgrimage and the visit to Mecca for Allah. And if ye are prevented, then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and shave not your heads until the gifts have reached their destination. And whoever among you is sick or hath an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering. And if ye are in safety, then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the pilgrimage shall give such gifts as can be had with ease. And whosoever cannot find such gifts, then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage, and of seven when ye have returned; that is, ten in all. That is for him whoso folk are not present at the Inviolable Place of Worship. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment. 196 The pilgrimage is in the well-known months, and whoever is minded to perform the pilgrimage therein let him remember that there is to be no lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. And whatsoever good ye do Allah knoweth it. So make provision for yourselves Hereafter; for the best provision is to ward off evil. Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of understanding. 197 It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord by trading. But, when ye press on in the multitude from 'Arafat, remember Allah by the sacred monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before ye were of those astray. 198 Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward, and ask forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 199 And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance. But of mankind is he who saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world," and he hath no portion in the Hereafter. 200 And of them also is he who saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and guard us from the doom of Fire." 201 For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they have earned. Allah is swift at reckoning. 202 Remember Allah through the appointed days. Then whoso hasteneth his departure by two days, it is no sin for him, and whoso delayeth, it is no sin for him; that is for him who wardeth off evil. Be careful of your duty to Allah, and know that unto Him ye will be gathered. 203 And of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this world pleaseth thee Muhammad, and he calleth Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart; yet he is the most rigid of opponents. 204 And when he turneth away from thee his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and Allah loveth not mischief. 205 And when it is said unto him: Be careful of thy duty to Allah, pride taketh him to sin. Hell will settle his account, an evil resting-place. 206 And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah; and Allah hath compassion on His bondmen. 207 O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission unto Him; and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 208 And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you, then know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 209 Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in the shadows of the clouds with the angels? Then the case would be already judged. All cases go back to Allah for judgment. 210 Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave them! He who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him for him, lo! Allah is severe in punishment. 211 Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they make a jest of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will. 212 Mankind were one community, and Allah sent unto them prophets as bearers of good tidings and as warners, and revealed therewith the Scripture with the truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed. And only those unto whom the Scripture was given differed concerning it, after clear proofs had come unto them, through hatred one of another. And Allah by His Will guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed. Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path. 213 Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of that which came to those who passed away before you? Affliction and adversity befell them, they were shaken as with earthquake, till the messenger of Allah and those who believed along with him said: When cometh Allah's help? Now surely Allah's help is nigh. 214 They ask thee, O Muhammad, what they shall spend. Say: that which ye spend for good must go to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer. And whatsoever good ye do, lo! Allah is Aware of it. 215 Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not. 216 They question thee O Muhammad with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great transgression, but to turn men from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein. 217 Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate to escape the persecution and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah's mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 218 They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In both is great sin, and some utility for men; but the sin of them is greater than their usefulness. And they ask thee what they ought to spend. Say: that which is superfluous. Thus Allah maketh plain to you His revelations, that haply ye may reflect. 219 Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who improveth. Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 220 Wed not idolatresses till they believe; for lo! a believing bondwoman is better than an idolatress though she please you; and give not your daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe, for lo! a believing slave is better than an idolater though he please you. These invite unto the Fire, and Allah inviteth unto the Garden, and unto forgiveness by His grace, and expoundeth His revelations to mankind that haply they may remember. 221 They question thee O Muhammad concerning menstruation. Say: It is an illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah hath enjoined upon you. Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth those who have a care for cleanness. 222 Your women are a tilth for you to cultivate so go to your tilth as ye will, and send good deeds before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know that ye will one day meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, O Muhammad. 223 And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance to your being righteous and observing your duty unto Him and making peace among mankind. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 224 Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths. But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered. Allah is Forgiving, Clement. 225 Those who forswear their wives must wait four months; then, if they change their mind, lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 226 And if they decide upon divorce let them remember that Allah is Hearer, Knower. 227 Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three monthly courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire a reconciliation. And they women have rights similar to those of men over them in kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 228 Divorce must be pronounced twice and then a woman must be retained in honour or released in kindness. And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them; except in the case when both fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits imposed by Allah. And if ye fear that they may not be able to keep the limits of Allah, in that case it is no sin for either of them if the woman ransom herself. These are the limits imposed by Allah. Transgress them not. For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits: such are wrong-doers. 229 And if he hath divorced her the third time, then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she hath wedded another husband. Then if he the other husband divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again if they consider that they are able to observe the limits of Allah. These are the limits of Allah. He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge. 230 When ye have divorced women, and they have reached their term, then retain them in kindness or release them in kindness. Retain them not to their hurt so that ye transgress the limits. He who doeth that hath wronged his soul. Make not the revelations of Allah a laughing-stock by your behaviour, but remember Allah's grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of wisdom, whereby He doth exhort you. Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is Aware of all things. 231 And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term, place not difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in kindness. This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day. That is more virtuous for you, and cleaner. Allah knoweth; ye know not. 232 Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; that is for those who wish to complete the suckling. The duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers in a seemly manner is upon the father of the child. No-one should be charged beyond his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child, nor should he to whom the child is born be made to suffer because of his child. And on the father's heir is incumbent the like of that which was incumbent on the father. If they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and after consultation, it is no sin for them; and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provide that ye pay what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is Seer of what ye do. 233 Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they the wives shall wait, keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term prescribed for them then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with themselves in decency. Allah is informed of what ye do. 234 There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds concerning your troth with women. Allah knoweth that ye will remember them. But plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognised form of words. And do not consummate the marriage until the term prescribed is run. Know that Allah knoweth what is in your minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement. 235 It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them, nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to his means, and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. This is a bounden duty for those who do good. 236 If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto them a portion, then pay the half of that which ye appointed, unless they the women agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie. To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget not kindness among yourselves. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 237 Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up with devotion to Allah. 238 And if ye go in fear, then pray standing or on horseback. And when ye are again in safety, remember Allah, as He hath taught you that which heretofore ye knew not. 239 In the case of those of you who are about to die and leave behind them wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without turning them out, but if they go out of their own accord there is no sin for you in that which they do of themselves within their rights. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 240 For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward off evil. 241 Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may understand. 242 Bethink thee O Muhammad of those of old, who went forth from their habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto them: Die; and then He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks. 243 Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearer, Knower. 244 Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, so that He may give it increase manifold? Allah straiteneth and enlargeth. Unto Him ye will return. 245 Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in Allah's way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you? They said: Why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our children? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, all save a few of them. Allah is aware of evil-doers. 246 Their Prophet said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up Saul to be a king for you. They said: How can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is, since he hath not been given wealth enough? He said: Lo! Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom and stature. Allah bestoweth His Sovereignty on whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 247 And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his kingdom is that there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of Moses and the house of Aaron left behind, the angels bearing it. Lo! herein shall be a token for you if in truth ye are believers. 248 And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by the ordeal of a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me, and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who taketh thereof in the hollow of his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he had crossed the river, he and those who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they would meet Allah exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by Allah's leave! Allah is with the steadfast. 249 And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they said: Our Lord! Bestow on us endurance, make our foothold sure, and give us help against the disbelieving folk. 250 So they routed them by Allah's leave and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of that which He willeth. And if Allah had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to His creatures. 251 These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee Muhammad with truth, and lo! thou art of the number of Our messengers; 252 Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He exalted above others in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs of Allah's Sovereignty and We supported him with the holy Spirit. And if Allah had so wiled it, those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear proofs had come unto them. But they differed, some of them believing and some disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with another; but Allah doeth what He will. 253 O ye who believe! spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a day come when there will be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor intercession. The disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers. 254 Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave? He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His throne includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous. 255 There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 256 Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe. He bringeth them out of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their patrons are false deities. They bring them out of light into darkness. Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 257 Bethink thee not of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it to come up from the West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 258 Or bethink thee of the like of him who, passing by a township which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He said: How long hast thou tarried? The man said: I have tarried a day or part of a day. He said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make thee a token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh! And when the matter became clear unto him, he said: I know now that Allah is Able to do all things. 259 And when Abraham said unto his Lord: My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe? Abraham said: Yea, but I ask in order that my heart may be at ease. His Lord said: Take four of the birds and cause them to incline unto thee, then place a part of them on each hill, then call them, they will come to thee in haste, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 260 The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way is as the likeness of a grain which groweth seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains. Allah giveth increase manifold to whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 261 Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward make not reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent; their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve. 262 A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury. Allah is Absolute, Clement. 263 O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury, like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is as the likeness of a rock whereon is dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare. They have no control of aught of that which they have gained. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 264 And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah's pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the likeness of a garden on a height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 265 Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein; and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring; and a fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is all consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations unto you, in order that ye may give thought. 266 O ye who believe! Spend of the good things which ye have earned, and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the bad with intent to spend thereof in charity when ye would not take it for yourselves save with disdain; and know that Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise. 267 The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness. But Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty. Allah is All-Embracing, All-knowing. 268 He giveth wisdom unto whom He will, and he unto whom wisdom is given, he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember except men of understanding. 269 Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow, lo! Allah knoweth it. Wrong-doers have no helpers. 270 If ye publish your almsgiving, it is well, but if ye hide it and give it to the poor, it will be better for you, and will atone for some of your ill-deeds. Allah is Informed of what ye do. 271 The guiding of them is not thy duty O Muhammad, but Allah guideth whom He will. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, it is for yourselves, when ye spend not save in search of Allah's Countenance; and whatsoever good thing ye spend, it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged. 272 Alms are for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah, who cannot travel in the land for trade. The unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of their restraint. Thou shalt know them by their mark: They do not beg of men with importunity. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, lo! Allah knoweth it. 273 Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly, verily their reward is with their Lord, and their shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 274 Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil hath prostrated by his touch. That is because they say: Trade is just like usury; whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury. He unto whom an admonition from his Lord cometh, and he refraineth in obedience thereto, he shall keep the profits of that which is past, and his affair henceforth is with Allah. As for him who returneth to usury - Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 275 Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful. Allah loveth not the impious and guilty. 276 Lo! those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 277 O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what remaineth due to you from usury, if ye are in truth believers. 278 And if ye do not, then be warned of war against you from Allah and His messenger. And if ye repent, then ye have your principal without interest. Wrong not, and ye shall not be wronged. 279 And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then let there be postponement to the time of ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you if ye did not know. 280 And guard yourselves against a day in which ye will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned, and they will not be wronged. 281 O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in terms of equity. No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of his interests dictate in terms of equity. And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not at hand then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if one of the two erreth through forgetfulness the one of them will remind. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down the contract whether it be small or great, with record of the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witnesses when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do harm to them lo! it is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of all things. 282 If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand shall suffice. And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that which is entrusted to him according to the pact between them and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord. Hide not testimony. He who hideth it, verily his heart is sinful. Allah is Aware of what ye do. 283 Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it, Allah will bring you to account for it. He will forgive whom He will and He will punish whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. 284 The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord and so do believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers - We make no distinction between any of His messengers - and they say: We hear, and we obey. Grant us Thy forgiveness, our Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying. 285 Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope. For it is only that which it hath earned, and against it only that which it hath deserved. Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget, or miss the mark! Our Lord! Lay not on us such a burden as thou didst lay on those before us! Our Lord! Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear! Pardon us, absolve us and have mercy on us, Thou, our Protector, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk. 286


O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty toward Allah in Whom ye claim your rights of one another, and toward the wombs that bare you. Lo! Allah hath been a watcher over you. 1 Give unto orphans their wealth. Exchange not the good for the bad in your management thereof nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth. Lo! that would be a great sin. 2 And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice to so many then one only or the captives that your right hands possess. Thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice. 3 And give unto the women whom ye marry free gift of their marriage portions; but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof, then ye are welcome to absorb it in your wealth. 4 Give not unto the foolish what is in your keeping of their wealth, which Allah hath given you to maintain; but feed and clothe them from it, and speak kindly unto them. 5 Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age; then, if ye find them of sound judgment, deliver over unto them their fortune; and devour it not by squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso of the guardians is rich, let him abstain generously from taking of the property of orphans; and whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason for his guardianship. And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans, have the transaction witnessed in their presence. Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner. 6 Unto the men of a family belongeth a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it be little or much - a legal share. 7 And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division of the heritage, bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them. 8 And let those fear in their behaviour toward orphans who if they left behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them. So let them mind their duty to Allah, and speak justly. 9 Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully, they do but swallow fire into their bellies, and they will be exposed to burning flame. 10 Allah chargeth you concerning the provision for your children: to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females, and if there be women more than two, then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one only then the half. And to of his parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he have a son; and if he have no son and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the third; and if he have brethren, then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt hath been paid. Your parents or your children: Ye know not which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness. It is an injunction from Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. 11 And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave, if they have no child; but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that which they leave, after any legacy they may have bequeathed, or debt they may have contracted, hath been paid. And unto them belongeth the fourth of that which ye leave if ye have no child, but if ye have a child then the eighth of that which ye leave, after any legacy ye may have bequeathed, or debt ye may have contracted, hath been paid. And if a man or a woman have a distant heir having left neither parent nor child, and he or she have a brother or a sister only on the mother's side then to each of them twain the brother and the sister the sixth, and if they be more than two, then they shall be sharers in the third, after any legacy that may have been bequeathed or debt contracted not injuring the heirs by willing away more than a third of the heritage hath been paid. A commandment from Allah. Allah is Knower, Indulgent. 12 These are the limits imposed by Allah. Whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, where such will dwell for ever. That will be the great success. 13 And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger and transgresseth His limits, He will make him enter Fire, where he will dwell for ever; his will be a shameful doom. 14 As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness, call to witness four of you against them. And if they testify to the truth of the allegation then confine them to the houses until death take them or until Allah appoint for them a way through new legislation. 15 And as for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both. And if they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo! Allah is ever relenting, Merciful. 16 Forgiveness is only incumbent on Allah towards those who do evil in ignorance and then turn quickly in repentance to Allah. These are they toward whom Allah relenteth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 17 The forgiveness is not for those who do ill-deeds until, when death attendeth upon one of them, he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yet for those who die while they are disbelievers. For such We have prepared a painful doom. 18 O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the women of your deceased kinsmen, nor that ye should put constraint upon them that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them, unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness. But consort with them in kindness, for if ye hate them it may happen that ye hate a thing wherein Allah hath placed much good. 19 And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money however great, take nothing from it. Would ye take it by the way of calumny and open wrong? 20 How can ye take it back after one of you hath gone in unto the other, and they have taken a strong pledge from you? 21 And marry not those women whom your fathers married, except what hath already happened of that nature in the past. Lo! it was ever lewdness and abomination, and an evil way. 22 Forbidden unto you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your father's sisters, and your mother's sisters, and your brother's daughters and your sister's daughters, and your foster-mothers, and your foster-sisters, and your mothers-in-law, and your step-daughters who are under your protection born of your women unto whom ye have gone in - but if ye have not gone in unto them, then it is no sin for you to marry their daughters - and the wives of your sons who spring from your own loins. And it is forbidden unto you that ye should have two sisters together, except what hath already happened of that nature in the past. Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 23 And all married women are forbidden? unto you save those captives whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content by marrying them, give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty hath been done. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 24 And whoso is not able to afford to marry free, believing women, let them marry from the believing maids whom your right hands possess. Allah knoweth best concerning your faith. Ye proceed one from another; so wed them by permission of their folk, and give unto them their portions in kindness, they being honest, not debauched nor of loose conduct. And if when they are honourably married they commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the punishment prescribed for free women in that case. This is for him among you who feareth to commit sin. But to have patience would be better for you. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 25 Allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who were before you, and would turn to you in mercy. Allah is Knower, Wise. 26 And Allah would turn to you in mercy; but those who follow vain desires would have you go tremendously astray. 27 Allah would make the burden light for you, for man was created weak. 28 O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity, except it be a trade by mutual consent, and kill not one another. Lo! Allah is ever Merciful unto you. 29 And whoso doeth that through aggression and injustice, we shall cast him into Fire, and that is ever easy for Allah. 30 If ye avoid the great things which ye are forbidden, We will remit from you your evil deeds and make you enter at a noble gate. 31 And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others. Unto men a fortune from that which they have earned, and unto women a fortune from that which they have earned. Envy not one another but ask Allah of His bounty. Lo! Allah is ever Knower of all things. 32 And unto each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near kindred leave; and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant, give them their due. Lo! Allah is ever Witness over all things. 33 Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property for the support of women. So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great. 34 And if ye fear a breach between them twain the man and wife, appoint an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they desire amendment Allah will make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware. 35 And serve Allah. Ascribe no thing as partner unto Him. Show kindness unto parents, and unto near kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and unto the neighbour who is of kin unto you and the neighbour who is not of kin, and the fellow-traveller and the wayfarer and the slaves whom your right hands possess. Lo! Allah loveth not such as are proud and boastful, 36 Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others, and hide that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty. For disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom; 37 And also those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men, and believe not in Allah nor the Last Day. Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade, a bad comrade hath he. 38 What have they to fear if they believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend aright of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them, when Allah is ever Aware of them and all they do? 39 Lo! Allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant; and if there is a good deed, He will double it and will give the doer from His presence an immense reward. 40 But how will it be with them when We bring of every people a witness, and We bring thee O Muhammad a witness against these? 41 On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground, and they can hide no fact from Allah. 42 O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands therewith. Lo! Allah is Benign, Forgiving. 43 Seest thou not those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given, how they purchase error, and seek to make you Muslims err from the right way? 44 Allah knoweth best who are your enemies. Allah is sufficient as a Friend, and Allah is sufficient as a Helper. 45 Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: "We hear and disobey; hear thou as one cannot be made hear not" and "Listen to us!" distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: "We hear and we obey: hear thou, and look at us" it had been better for them, and more upright. But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few. 46 O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given! Believe in what We have revealed confirming that which ye possess, before We destroy countenances so as to confound them, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers of old time. The commandment of Allah is always executed. 47 Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him. He forgiveth all save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners to Allah, he hath indeed invented a tremendous sin. 48 Hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity? Nay, Allah purifieth whom He will, and they will not be wronged even the hair upon a date-stone. 49 See, how they invent lies about Allah! That of itself is flagrant sin. 50 Hast thou not seen those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given, how they believe in idols and false deities, and how they say of those idolaters who disbelieve: "These are more rightly guided than those who believe"? 51 Those are they whom Allah hath cursed, and he whom Allah hath cursed, thou O Muhammad wilt find for him no helper. 52 Or have they even a share in the Sovereignty? Then in that case, they would not give mankind even the speck on a date-stone. 53 Or are they jealous of mankind because of that which Allah of His bounty hath bestowed upon them? For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham of old the Scripture and wisdom, and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom. 54 And of them were some who believed therein and of them were some who disbelived therein. Hell is sufficient for their burning. 55 Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 56 And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein for ever; there for them are pure companions - and We shall make them enter plenteous shade. 57 Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners, and, if ye judge between mankind, that ye judge justly. Lo! comely is this which Allah admonisheth you. Lo! Allah is ever Hearer, Seer. 58 O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority; and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the messenger if ye are in truth believers in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and more seemly in the end. 59 Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee, how they would go for judgment in their disputes to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure them? Satan would mislead them far astray. 60 And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger, thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion. 61 How would it be if a misfortune smote them because of that which their own hands have sent before them? Then would they come unto thee, swearing by Allah that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness. 62 Those are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth. So oppose them and admonish them, and address them in plain terms about their souls. 63 We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave. And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful. 64 But nay, by thy Lord, they will not believe in truth until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decidest, and submit with full submission. 65 And if We had decreed for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your dwellings, but few of them would have done it; though if they did what they are exhorted to do it would be better for them, and more strengthening; 66 And then We should bestow upon them from Our presence an immense reward, 67 And should guide them unto a straight path. 68 Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they! 69 That is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower. 70 O ye who believe! Take your precautions, then advance the proven ones, or advance all together. 71 Lo! among you there is he who loitereth; and if disaster overtook you, he would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me since I was not present with them. 72 And if a bounty from Allah befell you, he would surely cry, as if there had been no love between you and him: Oh, would that I had been with them, then should I have achieved a great success! 73 Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward. 74 How should ye not fight for the cause of Allah and of the feeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying: Our Lord! Bring us forth from out this town of which the people are oppressors! Oh, give us from thy presence some protecting friend! Oh, give us from Thy presence some defender! 75 Those who believe do battle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve do battle for the cause of idols. So fight the minions of the devil. Lo! the devil's strategy is ever weak. 76 Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said: Withhold your hands, establish worship and pay the poordue, but when fighting was prescribed for them behold! a party of them fear mankind even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear, and say: Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us? If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while! Say unto them, O Muhammad: The comfort of this world is scant; the Hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off evil; and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date-stone. 77 Wheresoever ye may be, death will overtake you, even though ye were in lofty towers. Yet if a happy thing befalleth them they say: This is from Allah; and if an evil thing befalleth them they say: This is of thy doing O Muhammad. Say unto them: All is from Allah. What is amiss with these people that they come not nigh to understand a happening? 78 Whatever of good befalleth thee O man it is from Allah, and whatever of ill befalleth thee it is from thyself. We have sent thee Muhammad as a messenger unto mankind and Allah is sufficient as Witness. 79 Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah, and whoso turneth away: We have not sent thee as a warder over them. 80 And they say: It is obedience; but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest. Allah recordeth what they plan by night. So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee. 81 Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an? If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity. 82 And if any tidings, whether of safety or fear, come unto them, they noise it abroad, whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as are in authority, those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it. If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have followed Satan, save a few of you. 83 So fight O Muhammad in the way of Allah Thou art not taxed with the responsibility for anyone except for thyself - and urge on the believers. Peradventure Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment. 84 Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whoso interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof. Allah overseeth all things. 85 When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a better than it or return it. Lo! Allah taketh count of all things. 86 Allah! There is no God save Him. He gathereth you all unto a Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Who is more true in statement than Allah? 87 What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites, when Allah cast them back to disbelief because of what they earned? Seek ye to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray? He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him thou O MUhammad canst not find a road. 88 They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level with them. So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back to enmity then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them, 89 Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant, or those who come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah alloweth you no way against them. 90 Ye will find others who desire that they should have security from you, and security from their own folk. So often as they are returned to hostility they are plunged therein. If they keep not aloof from you nor offer you peace nor hold their hands, then take them and kill them wherever ye find them. Against such We have given you clear warrant. 91 It is not for a believer to kill a believer unless it be by mistake. He who hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave, and pay the blood-money to the family of the slain, unless they remit it as a charity. If he the victim be of a people hostile unto you, and he is a believer, then the penance is to set free a believing slave. And if he cometh of a folk between whom and you there is a covenant, then the blood-money must be paid unto his folk and also a believing slave must be set free. And whoso hath not the wherewithal must fast two consecutive months. A penance from Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise. 92 Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is Hell for ever. Allah is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom. 93 O ye who believe! When ye go forth to fight in the way of Allah, be careful to discriminate, and say not unto one who offereth you peace: "Thou art not a believer," seeking the chance profits of this life so that ye may despoil him. With Allah are plenteous spoils. Even thus as he now is were ye before; but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you. Therefore take care to discriminate. Allah is ever Informed of what ye do. 94 Those of the believers who sit still, other than those who have a disabling hurt, are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives. Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank above the sedentary. Unto each Allah hath promised good, but He hath bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the sedentary; 95 Degrees of rank from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 96 Lo! as for those whom the angels take in death while they wrong themselves, the angels will ask: In what were ye engaged? They will say: We were oppressed in the land. The angels will say: Was not Allah's earth spacious that ye could have migrated therein? As for such, their habitation will be hell, an evil journey's end; 97 Except the feeble among men, and the women, and the children, who are unable to devise a plan and are not shown a way. 98 As for such, it may be that Allah will pardon them. Allah is ever Clement, Forgiving. 99 Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah will find much refuge and abundance in the earth, and whoso forsaketh his home, a fugitive unto Allah and His messenger, and death overtaketh him, his reward is then incumbent on Allah. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 100 And when ye go forth in the land, it is no sin for you to curtail your worship if ye fear that those who disbelieve may attack you. In truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you. 101 And when thou O Muhammad art among them and arrangest their worship for them, let only a party of them stand with thee to worship and let them take their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to the rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them worship with thee, and let them take their precaution and their arms. Those who disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all. It is no sin for you to lay aside your arms, if rain impedeth you or ye are sick. But take your precaution. Lo! Allah prepareth for the disbelievers shameful punishment. 102 When ye have performed the act of worship, remember Allah, standing, sitting and reclining. And when ye are in safety, observe proper worship. Worship at fixed times hath been enjoined on the believers. 103 Relent not in pursuit of the enemy. If ye are suffering, lo! they suffer even as ye suffer and ye hope from Allah that for which they cannot hope. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 104 Lo! We reveal unto thee the Scripture with the truth, that thou mayst judge between mankind by that which Allah showeth thee. And be not thou a pleader for the treacherous; 105 And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 106 And plead not on behalf of people who deceive themselves. Lo! Allah loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful. 107 They seek to hide from men and seek not to hide from Allah. He is with them when by night they hold discourse displeasing unto Him. Allah ever surroundeth what they do. 108 Lo! ye are they who pleaded for them in the life of the world. But who will plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will then be their defender? 109 Yet whoso doeth evil or wrongeth his own soul, then seeketh pardon of Allah, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. 110 Whoso committeth sin committeth it only against himself. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 111 And whoso committeth a delinquency or crime, then throweth the blame thereof upon the innocent, hath burdened himself with falsehood and a flagrant crime. 112 But for the grace of Allah upon thee Muhammad, and His mercy, a party of them had resolved to mislead thee, but they will mislead only themselves and they will hurt thee not at all. Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture and wisdom, and teacheth thee that which thou knewest not. The grace of Allah toward thee hath been infinite. 113 There is no good in much of their secret conferences save in him who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making among the people. Whoso doeth that, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shall bestow on him a vast reward. 114 And whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance of Allah hath been manifested unto him, and followeth other than the believer's way, We appoint for him that unto which he himself hath turned, and expose him unto hell - a hapless journey's end! 115 Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto Him. He pardoneth all save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah hath wandered far astray. 116 They invoke in His stead only females; they pray to none else than Satan, a rebel 117 Whom Allah cursed, and he said: Surely I will take of Thy bondmen an appointed portion, 118 And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires in them, and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle' ears, and surely I will command them and they will change Allah's creation. Whoso chooseth Satan for a patron instead of Allah is verily a loser and his loss is manifest. 119 He promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them, and Satan promiseth them only to beguile. 120 For such, their habitation will be hell, and they will find no refuge therefrom. 121 But as for those who believe and do good works We shall bring them into gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. It is a promise from Allah in truth; and who can be more truthful than Allah in utterance? 122 It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor the desires of the People of the Scripture. He who doeth wrong will have the recompense thereof, and will not find against Allah any protecting friend or helper. 123 And whoso doeth good works, whether of male or female, and he or she is a believer, such will enter paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a date-stone. 124 Who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good to men and followeth the tradition of Abraham, the upright? Allah Himself chose Abraham for friend. 125 Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Allah ever surroundeth all things. 126 They consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree concerning them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you giveth decree, concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them, and concerning the weak among children, and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever Aware of it. 127 If a woman feareth ill treatment from her husband, or desertion, it is no sin for them twain if they make terms of peace between themselves. Peace is better. But greed hath been made present in the minds of men. If ye do good and keep from evil, lo! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do. 128 Ye will not be able to deal equally between your wives, however much ye wish to do so. But turn not altogether away from one, leaving her as in suspense. If ye do good and keep from evil, lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 129 But if they separate, Allah will compensate each out of His abundance. Allah is ever All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 130 Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. And We charged those who received the Scripture before you, and We charge you, that ye keep your duty toward Allah. And if ye disbelieve, lo! unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and Allah is ever Absolute, Owner of Praise. 131 Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender. 132 If He will, He can remove you, O people, and produce others in your stead. Allah is Able to do that. 133 Whoso desireth the reward of the world, let him know that with Allah is the reward of the world and the Hereafter. Allah is ever Hearer, Seer. 134 O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for Allah, even though it be against yourselves or your parents or your kindred, whether the case be of a rich man or a poor man, for Allah is nearer unto both them ye are. So follow not passion lest ye lapse from truth and if ye lapse or fall away, then lo! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do. 135 O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger, and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime. Whoso disbelieveth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers and the Last Day, he verily hath wandered far astray. 136 Lo! those who believe, then disbelieve and then again believe, then disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, Allah will never pardon them, nor will He guide them unto a way. 137 Bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is a painful doom; 138 Those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers! Do they look for power at their hands? Lo! all power appertaineth to Allah. 139 He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that, when ye hear the revelations of Allah rejected and derided, ye sit not with them who disbelieve and mock until they engage in some other conversation. Lo! in that case if ye stayed ye would be like unto them. Lo! Allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers, all together, into hell; 140 Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and, if a victory cometh unto you from Allah, say: Are we not with you? and if the disbelievers meet with a success say: Had we not the mastery of you, and did we not protect you from the believers? - Allah will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will not give the disbelievers any way of success against the believers. 141 Lo! the hypocrites seek to beguile Allah, but it is He Who beguileth them. When they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men, and are mindful of Allah but little; 142 Swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those. He whom Allah causeth to go astray, thou O Muhammad wilt not find a way for him: 143 O ye who believe! Choose not disbelievers for your friends in place of believers. Would ye give Allah a clear warrant against you? 144 Lo! the hypocrites will be in the lowest deep of the Fire, and thou wilt find no helper for them; 145 Save those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and make their religion pure for Allah only. Those are with the believers. And Allah will bestow on the believers an immense reward. 146 What concern hath Allah for your punishment if ye are thankful for His mercies and believe in Him? Allah was ever Responsive, Aware. 147 Allah loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been wronged. Allah is ever Hearer, Knower. 148 If ye do good openly or keep it secret, or forgive evil, lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Powerful. 149 Lo! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and seek to make distinction between Allah and His messengers, and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others, and seek to choose a way in between; 150 Such are disbelievers in truth; and for disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom. 151 But those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them, unto them Allah will give their wages; and Allah was ever Forgiving, Merciful. 152 The people of the Scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an actual Book to descend upon them from heaven. They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime, for they said: Show us Allah plainly. The storm of lightning seized them for their wickedness. Then even after that they chose the calf for worship after clear proofs of Allah's Sovereignty had come unto them. And We forgave them that! And We bestowed on Moses evident authority. 153 And We caused the Mount to tower above them at the taking of their covenant: and We bade them: Enter the gate, prostrate! and We bade them: Transgress not the Sabbath! and We took from them a firm covenant. 154 Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in the revelations of Allah, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but Allah set a seal upon them for their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few - 155 And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny; 156 And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain. 157 But Allah took him up unto Himself. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise. 158 There is not one of the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them - 159 Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were before made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from Allah's way, 160 And of their taking usury when they were forbidden it, and of their devouring people's wealth by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a painful doom. 161 But those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in that which is revealed unto thee, and that which was revealed before thee, especially the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poor-due, the believers in Allah and the Last Day. Upon these We shall bestow immense reward. 162 Lo! We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, as We inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as We imparted unto David the Psalms; 163 And messengers We have mentioned unto thee before and messengers We have not mentioned unto thee; and Allah spake directly unto Moses; 164 Messengers of good cheer and of warning, in order that mankind might have no argument against Allah after the messengers. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise. 165 But Allah Himself testifieth concerning that which He hath revealed unto thee; in His knowledge hath He revealed it; and the Angels also testify. And Allah is sufficient Witness. 166 Lo! those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of Allah, they verily have wandered far astray. 167 Lo! those who disbelieve and deal in wrong, Allah will never forgive them, neither will He guide them unto a road, 168 Except the road of hell, wherein they will abide for ever. And that is ever easy for Allah. 169 O mankind! The messenger hath come unto you with the Truth from your Lord. Therefor believe; it is better for you. But if ye disbelieve, still, lo! unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 170 O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease! it is better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His transcendent majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender. 171 The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah, nor will the favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him; 172 Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against Allah, any protecting friend or helper. 173 O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent down unto you a clear light; 174 As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast unto Him, them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight road. 175 They ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: Allah hath pronounced for you concerning distant kindred. If a man die childless and he have a sister, hers is half the heritage, and he would have inherited from her had she died childless. And if there be two sisters, then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage, and if they be brethren, men and women, unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. Allah expoundeth unto you, so that ye err not. Allah is Knower of all things. 176 


Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, 2 The Beneficent, the Merciful. 3 Owner of the Day of Judgment, 4 Thee alone we worship; Thee alone we ask for help. 5 Show us the straight path, 6 The path of those whom Thou hast favoured. Not the path of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray. 7
